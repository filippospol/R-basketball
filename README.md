## Analysing Basketball Data

Hello! In this repository you can find several `R` scripts that I have been working on and help me look into interesting stuff that occur throughout each basketball season:

* Scraper functions to extract data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), [Euroleague](https://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/en/euroleague/) and [PBP Stats](https://www.pbpstats.com/).
* Custom options for tables and charts on `ggplot` and `gt` libraries.
* Fun projects!
