#### Analyzing Lineups

In this folder you can find scripts that analyze lineup data, from 2-man and 5-man group net ratings to replicating Owen Phillips' <a href="https://thef5.substack.com/p/health-luck" target="_blank">lineup continuity</a> chart.

Another script returns player positions in <a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/guide/player_positions" target="_blank">Cleaning The Glass</a> format.
