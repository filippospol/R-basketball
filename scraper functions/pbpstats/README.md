#### Scraping data from PBP Stats
 
This folder contains scraper functions that import stats from [PBP Stats](https://www.pbpstats.com/).

This is a very useful resource, as it offers enhanced data from the play-by-play such as different types of shots, efficiency after different events, types of turnovers etc.

Perhaps the most interesting feature is the **On/Off** tab, where you get stats for when a combination of players are on and off the court.

An example of that can be found in the [Fancy WOWY](https://github.com/filippospol/R-basketball/blob/main/scraper%20functions/pbpstats/fancy_wowy.R) script, where you can display team efficiency when player X is on and off the court in a nice tabular format.
