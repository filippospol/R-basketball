## Scraping data from Basketball Reference

In this folder you can find numerous functions that scrape data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

Apart from player and team stats (advanced metrics, shooting locations etc.), other functions enable users to access number of unique lineups per season, pre-season total wins odds and game logs with info on players' status (Inactive, DNP, Starter).
